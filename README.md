# The Perfect Aligner
There is no such thing as a perfect aligner. So what is this? The goal of this project is simple. It is to answer this question. If you had a perfect aligner, what would its output be?

Even though we can't create the perfect aligner, we can compute its output. By FAKING IT!

Given a reference sequence (or generating one randomly), ThePerfectAligner will generate FASTQ and the SAM that a perfect aligner would generate if fed with that reference sequence and FASTQ.

Why would you do this? How is this useful? Well, if you were writing an aligner, wouldn't you want known good input and output to test with?
